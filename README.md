Allegro Wrapper
===============

Allegro Wrapper is an object oriented wrapper of the Allegro library (version 4). It has been developed during the Object Oriented Programming course, academic year 2012/2013, University of Calabria. It also includes an example game, called Blow Up the Balloons.

To build the example game you need the Allegro library. In Debian, install the following packages:

 * liballegro4.2-dev
 * liballegro4.4
 * liballegro4.4-plugin-alsa
 
After installing all the required packages, run

 $ make
 
to compile everything into a runnable file BlowUpTheBalloons. Use

 $ ./BlowUpTheBalloons
 
to run the game. Enjoy!
